## Project Overview

This final project consists of three main phases, covering digital design, FPGA-based system integration, hardware-software co-design, and GPU programming. The goal is to build and evaluate an end-to-end MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) system using Verilog, FPGA boards, and CUDA.

### Phase 1
Implement an MLP forward-pass using Verilog and demonstrate correct functionality through simulation.  
This includes module design, testbench verification, and output validation.

### Phase 2
**Part 1:** Build a Nios II system on the FPGA platform.  
**Part 2:** Load the Phase 1 MLP Verilog design onto two FPGA boards, establish communication between them, and implement model-parallel MLP execution.

### Phase 3
Use CUDA to implement the MLP forward computation, run the program on GPU, and evaluate performance and correctness.
